# JS-Notes App
You will be building a notes web app similiar to the apple's notes app.
## User Story -
As a user, you want an app that can create and save notes, so that you can write down things you need to remember anytime of the day.

### Instructions -
Using html, css, and javascript, you'll be building a notes app that the user can use to write important information down. Don't worry about any rich text features like bold, cursive, or italics. The Note should have a title section and underneath it, it should have the actual notes that the user can type. Make sure to have 2 buttons for the user to either save their notes or cancel their notes.

### Technoligies used -
So long as you use html, css, and javascript, you can use any type of framework you are comfortable with. I can recommend some libraries to make writing the syntax easier.

#### JS Library:
jQuery: [jQuery Page](https://jquery.com/),
jQueryCDN: [Link](https://releases.jquery.com/) **Note**: use slim version

#### CSS Library:
Bootstrap: [Bootstrap Page](https://getbootstrap.com/)

#### APIs:
You'll need to use localstorage API to save these notes to the browser and store them in the browser.

LocalStorage: [Local Storage Docs](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_win_localstorage.asp)

## Acceptence Criteria
The user is able to input the note title and value. Using the buttons, the user can either save or cancel the note. Lastly, when refreshing the page, the user should be able to still see any existing notes that are saved to localstorage.


### Bonus: Hard Mode ###
Using just a external/internal stylesheet and external javascript file, create the whole app and append it to the div with root. The body should not be modified in anyway except to attach a script section to it.
